# JumpByte

JumpByte is an original 2D platformer built with Python and Pygame. Play as a rat, explore five themed worlds, collect coins, use speed boosts, stomp enemy cats, and defeat the final boss.

The game uses original Pygame-drawn characters and scenery with procedurally generated sound effects. It does not use Mario characters, names, sprites, or sounds.

## Features

- Five worlds: Green Meadow, Moonlit Cave, Sunset Castle, Frostfall Peaks, and Skyforge Citadel
- Rat character with movement, jumping, gravity, and platform collisions
- Cat enemies that patrol and fire projectiles
- Stomping attacks, including a health-based final boss with an enraged phase
- Coins required to unlock each world’s exit
- Speed-boost power-ups
- Mid-world checkpoints, lives, respawn, game-over, and restart
- Original scenery, platform details, animated characters, and visual effects
- Generated sound effects for collecting coins, jumping, stomping, and taking damage
- `M` key to mute or unmute sound effects
- Start, pause, game-over, and victory screens

1. **Green Meadow** — collect every coin and reach the exit.
2. **Moonlit Cave** — collect every coin and avoid the patrolling cats.
3. **Sunset Castle** — collect every coin and reach the exit.

## Project files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `main.py` | Starts the game |
| `game.py` | Game loop, events, stages, collisions, and drawing |
| `player.py` | Player movement, jumping, and animation |
| `enemy.py` | Cat enemies, projectiles, and boss |
| `objects.py` | Platforms, coins, and power-ups |

## Python concepts used

The project uses variables, conditionals, loops, functions, modules, lists, tuples, dictionaries, classes, objects, and inheritance. `Boss` inherits from `Enemy`; the game stores platforms, coins, enemies, and power-ups in collections.

## Project note

This is an educational, AI-assisted project. The project leader integrated and tested the game code. Team members should describe their actual contributions and explain only the modules they understand.
